					<h1>This is an excerpt from a study in progress.</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Today I want to briefly talk about a study I'm conducting, and--more importantly--some of the concepts and conclusions that I'm drawing from that study.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section id="slide3">
					<h1>(and a manifesto of sorts)</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Fair Warning: I think there is something of a manifesto within these conclusions. But I think this is an important conversation, and I hope that my brief presentation can be a starting point, and I hope that it can help us begin to better think about the work of producing more accessible digital scholarship.</p>

					<h1>The Takeaway:</h1>
					<h2>It is time to reevaluate how we value &amp; credit the work of producing digital scholarship</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>And that's my main point: that it is time to reevaluate how we value &amp; credit the work of producing digital scholarship. And producing is the key word here. We are in a moment where our field has several venues for born-digital scholarship, but our professional reward systems still reflect a publication system in which editorial work is invisible, or considered part of service. The composing or editing of the actual hypertext, or the frame, is too easily seen as something separate from the piece itself, acknowledged on a "thank you" page, or an unattached editorial page--an remnant of print culture. And without proper attribution or professional rewards, how will we encourage young scholars to find expertise in the conventions of digital accessibility?</p>

				<section id="slide5">
					<h1>A Brief Case Study:</h1>
					<h2>Digital Literary Publications</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>As a way to think through these questions, I've been designing a study of literary magazines. I think they offer an interesting point of comparison, as the past few years have seen a significant rise in both born-digital literary publications as well as traditional print publications transitioning into a digital form. I think they serve as a compelling model for the future of digital scholarship.</p>

					<h1>Eleven randomly selected online-only publications</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Today, I will show you the results of eleven randomly selected publications from that study.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section id="slide7">
					<h1>Measured for four basic web accessibility components</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I'm measuring pages from each site for the most basic of accessibility standards: alt text for images, headings or some sort of organized structure for navigating the page, and either ARIA landmark roles or a semantic HTML5 structure that denotes specific elements: header, footer, navigation, etc. The following table shows the results for the index pages of 11 of those sites.</p>

						<p>So, as you can see, only one site had alt text for every image. Three sites had no alt text at all, with site #5 being the most egregious. Approximately 50% of the sites had some sort of organized, heading-based structure, but only two of the sites employed either landmarks or a semantic HTML5 structure. I measured the development tool based on signs in the markup, and there were a variety used--and, while Wordpress sites to fare better (which I attribute to professionally designed themes), there are still problems--see, for example, site 7, which only had alt text for 12/21 pages.</p>
						<p>In short, what I'm seeing in this study is a move toward web distribution--but one that relies on a few standard tools. Without a thorough understanding of those tools or the guidelines for web accessibility, those publications carry print conventions, and print ableism, into a digital space.</p>

						<p>Some observations</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section id="slide10">
					<h1>1. Even basic accessibility concerns are obscured in many CMS &amp; GUI web development applications.</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>First, a graphic development tool--especially a CMS like Wordpress-is often only as good as the theme used. So, as we know, the theme brings with it a number of arguments and assumptions about accessibility--many of which the end user might not even know are in place. Additionally, the importance of alt text can be downplayed or obscured in many CMS composing environments.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section id="slide11">
					<h1>(the recurring debate of markup vs. interface)</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p> This echoes the ongoing debate about markup-based composing environments versus graphic composing environments. Sure, if everyone in the field had a thorough understanding of HTML, this would be less of an issue.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section id="slide12">
					<h1>Beyond a Members-Only Club of Coders</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>But I want to extend the conversation beyond the you-should-learn-to-code discourse.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section id="slide13">
					<h1>Instead: Reconsidering the Role of Expertise</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>And instead shift it toward considerations of expertise.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section id="slide14">
					<h1>2. Design &amp; Digital Production Work Must Be Professionally Rewarded</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Specifically, I want to argue that work of producing digital texts must be professionally rewarded.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section id="slide15">
					<h1>Publication Credits</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>And by rewarded I mean publication credit, and publication credit that extends beyond an acknowledgment listed in the final node of a hypertext piece or a listing on an editors page.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section id="slide16">
					<h1>Tenure Cases</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>But rather acknowledgment that is front-loaded and can stand as viable and accepted work toward tenure cases. I don't think everyone needs to learn a given markup language or the ins and outs of W3C accessibility guidelines. But I do think that, in each project, there should be a collaborator, an expert, that does. And we can't get to that point if we don't reward expertise. If digital production and editorial work is filed under "service to the field," we are going to have a hard time encouraging markup-savvy scholars to enter these collaborations.</p>

					<h1>3. The Digital Current Traditional: A Warning</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Finally, I worry that a continuation of our current digital composition habits means we will be heading into what I'm calling the Digital Current Traditional.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section id="slide18">
					<blockquote class="welch">
						<p>“perhaps the recognition of all five canons and the definitive twentieth-century erasure of memory and delivery will lead to the obliteration of the current-traditional paradigm and its twin the false binary opposition of content and form” (147).</p>

						<p>&mdash;Kathleen Welch, from <cite>Electric Rhetoric</cite> (1999)</p>
					</blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I borrow this from Kathleen Welch, who said in 1999 [read quote]. Welch saw the current traditional paradigm as a product of composing practices that downplayed the role of memory and delivery--focusing instead on the canons that related to "content." While today's digital work does a better job of engaging those canons and employing multiple modalities, I worry that--without a focus on things like alt text, captions, and landmarks--we're working toward only one mode of reading, and a mode that clearly denotes who is allowed to engage and who is not. Or, in other words:</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p> I worry that the future of digital scholarship is one of content delivered in a singular, visual, and unintentionally ableist form. After the remaining presentations, I hope we can discuss ways to prevent this future.</p>
